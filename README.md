## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong growth mindset and a passion for continuous learning. After developing creativity, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills through my background in design and photography, I decided to transition into Data Analytics. I strengthened my analytical and technical skills through Workintech’s intensive 3-month Data Analytics program, gaining experience with SQL, BigQuery, dbt, Power BI, and Looker Studio.
